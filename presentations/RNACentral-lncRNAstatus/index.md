## FAANG-COST Hackathon 

* Jan Gorodkin organized a FAANG-COST hackathon in Copenhagen from 24.-25.11.2016

* The purpose was to initiate a community effort to establish a ncRNA database for farm animals

* I present here current state of the lncRNA subpart of it

* In total 11 persons are working at the moment in that subgroub

* The focus is currently on 5 (cow, pig, horse, chicken, sheep) animals

## Data collection and filtering

* The European Nucleotide Archive was used to collect public available datasets

* In addition team members made own datasets available to the group

* Criterias to include data into the collection were

   * Illumina
   * Paired-end reads
   * At least 100bp
   * Strand specific libraries

---

## Quality control and Data description

* All obtained raw files were quality controlled with 

    * FastQC
    * MultiQC
    * Tailored scripts (e.g. strandness validation)

* For all files, among others, the following meta-data were archived:
    
    * Tissue (Brenda Ontology terms)
    * Corresponding references
    * ENA accession number
