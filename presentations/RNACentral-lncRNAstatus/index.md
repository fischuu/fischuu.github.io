## FAANG-COST Hackathon 

* Jan Gorodkin organized a FAANG-COST hackathon in Copenhagen from 24.-25.11.2016

* The purpose was to initiate a community effort to establish a ncRNA database for farm animals

* I present here current state of the lncRNA subpart of it

* In total 11 persons are working at the moment in that subgroub

* The focus is currently on 5 (cow, pig, horse, chicken, sheep) animals

---

## Data collection and filtering

* Datasets were collected from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)

* In addition team members made own datasets available to the group

* Criterias to include data into the collection were

   * Illumina
   * Paired-end reads
   * At least 100bp
   * Strand specific libraries

---

## Quality control and Data curation

* All obtained raw files were quality controlled with 

    * FastQC
    * MultiQC
    * Tailored scripts (e.g. strandness validation)

* For all files, among others, the following meta-data were archived:
    
    * Tissue (Brenda Ontology terms)
    * Corresponding references
    * ENA accession number
    

---

## Pipelines established

We established two different pipelines to annotate lncRNA:

The "HS"" pipeline:

    * HISAT2
    * StringTie
    * FEELnc
    
The "SC" pipeline:
    
    * STAR
    * Cufflinks
    * FEELnc

## Used Genome Versions and available samples

| Species   |      Genome        |  Avail. Samples |
|-----------|:------------------:|----------------:|
| Chicken   |  Gallus_gallus-5.0 |   171           |
| Cow       |  UMD_3.1.1         |   447           |
| Horse     |  EquCab2.0         |    62           |
| Pig       |  Sscrofa11.1       |   149           |
| Sheep     |  Oar_v4.0          |   195           |

## Pipeline comparison

* Sarah Djebali performed an extensive comparison on the two different pipelines for cow and chicken

* For that, we tried to run both pipelines with and without gene annotations

* Tissues were considered individually and also merged (1,2 and all)

* Total number of transcript sets to evaluate:

    * 1 gene annotation + 24 predictions for chicken
    * 1 gene annotation + 32 predictions for cattle

## Impacts of the comparisons

* Stringtie has improved a lot between version 1.3.2 and 1.3.3
  * Many less unstranded transcripts
  * Length of exons of different types better
  * Less impacted by not having an annotation
  * More similar results on both species
* Stringtie becomes a tool that can be envisionned for FAANG,
   although its results are more dependent on the annotation
   quality and this one can be very variable for livestock species

---

## FEELnc performance

* Each pipeline produced one gtf as inoput for FEELnc

* The coverage for lncRNA annotation is also crucial and at least 70 Mio reads are desired

* Most of the available datasets couldn't fulfil this criteria

* Consequently, we chose 30 Mio as threshold for a high-coverage set

* That means: 4 different input gtfs per species.

* Compilation of small, long and structured RNA

* For multiple animal genomes
   - Syntenic ncRNAs
   - Tissue expression
   - QTL
   - Conservation of features

---

## Vision for the FAANG non-coding and structured RNA (ncRNA) database II

* Integration with ENSEMBL will feed into external resources e.g.:
   - The tissues database[*]
