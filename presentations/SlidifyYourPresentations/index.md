## RStudio

* Supposedly all of you have heard about RStudio.

* First version (v0.92) of RStudio was published in February 2011.

* Back then there were plenty of competing R editors, but these days RStudio became the quasi standard.

* The popularity of RStudio is due to its large amount of included features.

* RStudio is available as desktop and server version.

* RStudio also powers 'Shiny', a web application framework for R.

* One not so common, but very useful feature is the project feature.

## GitHub

* Supposedly most of you also have heard about GitHub (or at least git)

* git is a revision control system, initially developed 2005 by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel.

* GitHub is a filehosting service (founded 2008) that is based on the git technology. 

* GitHub is designed especially for the development of larger software projects (branch, merge, fork). 

* It is getting more and more popular to keep R-packages only on GitHub and not to submit to Cran. 

* Researchers can apply for free private repositories via [GitHub education] (https://education.github.com/).

* GitHub provides webspace for webpages via [GitHub pages] (https://pages.github.com/).

## GitHub pages

* If you have a GitHub account, you could create a repository called 

_username_.github.io

* Then, you can reach your webpage via

[http://username.github.io](http://username.github.io)

* To make things work properly, you should create a file

index.html

in the uppest level of the repository.
