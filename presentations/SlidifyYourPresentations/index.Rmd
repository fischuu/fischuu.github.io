## RStudio

* Supposedly all of you have heard about RStudio.

* First version (v0.92) of RStudio was published in February 2011.

* Back then there were plenty of competing R editors, but these days RStudio became the quasi standard.

* The popularity of RStudio is due to its large amount of included features.

* RStudio is available as desktop and server version.

* RStudio also powers 'Shiny', a web application framework for R.

* One not so common, but very useful feature is the project feature.

---

## GitHub

* Supposedly most of you also have heard about GitHub (or at least git)

* git is a revision control system, initially developed 2005 by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel.

* GitHub is a filehosting service (founded 2008) that is based on the git technology. 

* GitHub is designed especially for the development of larger software projects (branch, merge, fork). 

* It is getting more and more popular to keep R-packages only on GitHub and not to submit to Cran. 

* Researchers can apply for free private repositories via [GitHub education] (https://education.github.com/).

* GitHub provides webspace for webpages via [GitHub pages] (https://pages.github.com/).


---

## GitHub pages

* If you have a GitHub account, you could create a repository called 

_username_.github.io

* Then, you can reach your webpage via

[http://username.github.io](http://username.github.io)

* To make things work proper, you should create a file

index.html

in the uppest level of the repository. 

* Starting from there, you can have several subpages that can be stored in subfolders of your repository.
  
* It is advisable to name the entry page of ech subproject also index.html

## Setting up space for presentations on _GitHub pages_

* I recommend to use Linux, as this comes with practical all developer software installed. 

* If your IT doesn't allow Linux, you could e.g. install it on a VirtualBox parallel to Windows so that you can literally switch between OS as you switch between Tools.

* Connect your computer to GitHub by providing an SSH keypair (create it in RStudio and add it to the profile at GitHub), this makes life easier.

* A step-by-step tutorial for this is provided by GitHub [here] (https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).

## Setting up the GitHub repository

---

## Cloning to RStudio I

* It is important to tick the box

_Initialize this repository with a README_

* Having an initial README file in the repository enables us to clone it without any further problems.

* From the repository we get then its address (either HTTPS, SSH or Subversion)

* For RStudio we should copy the SSH address, e.g. in my case:

git@github.com:fischuu/fischuu.github.io.git

* We start RStudio and create a new project.

## Cloning to RStudio II

## Cloning to RStudio III

## Cloning to RStudio IV

* In the dialog we choose 

  1. Version Control
  
  2. Git
  
  3. And then we provide the URL (as SSH) of the repository, the name and location on HDD
  
* Then, we click on _'Create Project'_

* RStudio clones into the repository creates the folder/file structure on the HDD

* Now we can create an own folder structure (e.g. _presentations_, _lectures_, etc.)

* After those steps, we have succesful connected RStudio with GitHub pages and we can control the repository entirely with RStudio
