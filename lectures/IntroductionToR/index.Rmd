## Overview

1. Introduction

2.

---

## History of R

* R was started by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (the ”R & R’s” of the University of Auckland) in 1992.

* R is an environment and language for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.

* R is published under GNU licence. This means it is an open source program and is distributed for free.

* R can be seen as an implementation or dialect of the S language. S was developed by Becker and Chambers 1984.

* The origin of the name is not known anymore (although there are obvious possibilities...).

---

## Why to use R?

* It is _easy_. Compared to real programming languages, R has a simplified syntax that can be used without big learning efforts.

* It is _open source_. This means you can alter or check every piece of code (or hope at least that someone else does it...).

* It is _friendly_. Usually the mailing lists (”Rhelp”) or online discussion forums (e.g. 'StackOverflow') are fast, friendly and helpful.

* It is an _universal tool_. Usually there is a function in R for everything, or if there isn’t, soon there will be.

---

## Why not to use R?

* It is _difficult_. Compared to graphical-interface based tools like Excel a console might be shocking and repellent.

* It is _open source_. This means, you have to trust the functions are correct - but noone gives you a warranty for this. Use it on own risk!

* It is _hostile_. Mailing lists (”Rhelp”) or online discussion forums (e.g. 'StackOverflow') don’t like reocurring questions or questions showing no own efforts to solve a problem.

* It is _static_. These days the figures are too static compared to other, competing languages like Matlab. You hardly can interact with created figures.

* It is _slow_. Compared to real programming languages, R is slow (the price for being easy...), but C,C++ and other languages can be included into R programs to boost the speed.

---

## Where to get R?

* R is pre-compiled available for every common operating system, like Windows, Linux and Mac , and also for 32 and 64bit.

* It can be downloaded from the CRAN (”Comprehensive R Archive Network”) webpage: [http://cran.r-project.org] (http://cran.r-project.org).

* Usually there are 2-3 major updates per year.

* Linux user that use the apt package system, can include the CRAN server into it and receive those updates then automatically.

* On CRAN are also thousands of additional extensions (”packages”) available.

* The [Bioconductor] (https://www.bioconductor.org/) projects offers on top of that also hundreds of packages specialized for genomic data analysis.


---

## How does R look like?

![](assets/img/RStudio.png)

---

## How to use a console?

* The symbol that 'waits' for the input is usually the > sign.

* One usually types the command there and sends it to the interpreter by pressing the Return key.

* If a command line starts with + instead of > the interpreter expects further input.

* Common reason for this are still open parantheses or quotations.

* A history of the last commands is accesible using the arrow keys ↑↓.

* The console is case-sensitive.

## How to start?

---

## The script window

* Using the console is alright for simple commands, but as soon as you apply a sequence of commands it gets messy

* For larger projects (e.g. analysing datasets) it is much more convenient to write and run a _script_.

* This has the advantage that the commands can easily be stored, changed and distributed.

* It is much easier to keep the overview over the project.

* It is easier to prepare the script and run it then as whole.

* Copy+Paste for similar tasks

---

## Where to get help?

* For each function in R exists a help file, that can be accessed with `?`
  This means, in order to get the help for the function foo type `?foo` into the console.

* If you forgot a function name but have a wild guess how it was, the `apropos()` command is usefull.
  In order to check for all commands that contain the word ’test’ type `apropos("test")`.

* Of course Google is always a good place to search 

* A very helpful online ressource is also http://www.stackoverflow.com


---

## A typical workflow in R

1. Open the data with a (good...) text editor or Excel and inspect its properties:

  a. Is the first line a _header-line_?

  b. What is the separator between the columns?

2. Import the data to R

3. Apply some data transformation and calculate desired statistics

4. Visualize the results

5. Store all results

--- .segue .dark

## Import Data to R

---

## Working directory I

* The term ’working directory’ refers in R to the place on the hard drive, where R looks for files, stores Figures etc.

* All paths and filenames that are given relative to this specific location.

* Of course it is possible to check and change this location. 

* A typical workflow of a project is that in the beginning the working directory is set to the project folder on the hard drive.

* The command to check the working directory is `getwd()` and the one for setting it is `setwd()`.

---

## Working directory II

* An example how the working directory is extracted and set using windows:

```{r wd, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
> [1] "C:/Program Files/R/R-3.0.2"
setwd("C:/temp/")
getwd()
> [1] "C:/temp"
```

* The file system is a bit different in Linux, a typical path looks there like
/home/ejo123/myProjects.

---

## Import ASCII files I

* Datasets that are imported to R are typically given in ASCII format. .

* Other formats are possible, but I'd recommend to stay with ASCII/text files.

ASCII is a plain text format and common file extensions are .txt or .csv. Before reading
files into R it is advisable to open them first with a text editor in order to
check the properties of the files. One should focus especially on the
following things:

1. What is the column separator (Whitespace, comma, tab, etc.)?

2. Is the first line a data line or does it contain the variable names?

3. Are real numbers given with comma or point (e.g. is it 5,25 or 5.25)?

4. How is missing data encoded (e.g. NA, dot, whitespace)?

---

## Import ASCII files II

In order to read an ASCII file to R, we perform the following steps:

1. Set the working directory to the path where the data is located.

2. Check for above mentioned properties

3. Read the data and assign it to an object. The command is

```{r , eval=FALSE}
myData <- read.table(file="theData.txt", header=FALSE, sep="\t")
```

In this case the first line contained already data (If the first line are the
variable names, the option is `header=TRUE`) and the columns are
separated with TAB (\t is the so-called escape-seqence for TAB, other
separators are usually given as they are.)

---

## Import ASCII files III

Overview of important import options in `read.table()`:

* `sep` What is the column separator? Typical values are: `","`, `";"`, `" "`, `"\t"`

* `header` Logical, contains the first row variable names or not? Possible values:`TRUE`, `FALSE`

* `na.string` How are missing values encoded? Typical values: `NA`, `"."`

* `dec` What is used as decimal symbol?

* `as.is` Logical, shall R try to predict the ’right’ data format?

* `colclasses` Vector of predefined column classes.

* `stringsAsFactors` Logical, handle strings as factors?

---

## Import other files to R

Other file formats can also be imported to R, but it usually requires more
efforts.

There are functions that read, e.g. Excel tables, but it is not very
advisable to use them, as those data formats are usually proprietary and
hence developers cannot provide full functionality. The easiest way to
import an excel sheet to R is it to open it with Excel, save it as ASCII file
and procede as above mentioned.

Another way to import data is to connect directly to a MySQL database,
but this is above the scope of the course and will be discussed in an
advanced course.

---

## Example data

* You can download example data from here:
   [Titanic-data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fischuu/fischuu.github.io/master/lectures/IntroductionToR/data/titanic3.csv)
   [stressEcho](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fischuu/fischuu.github.io/master/lectures/IntroductionToR/data/stressEcho.csv)

* Just Right-click, choose 'Save as' and store them on your HDD.

* These datasets we will use throughout the whole course to learn the different methods.

"Data obtained from [http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/DataSets] (http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/DataSets)".

## Hands-on: Import the Example data

1. After having downloaded the titanic data, import it to R and name it `titanic`

2. After having downloaded the stress echo data, import it to R and name it `stress`



(If you have your own data, )

---

## Hint

1. Open the file in a text editor (NOT Word)

2. Check the first line, is a header present or not?

3. How are the different cells separated?

---

## Solution: Import the Titanic data

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("/home/ejo138/Projects/lectures/IntroductionToR")
titanic <- read.table("titanic3.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
stress <- read.table("stressEcho.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
titanic <- read.table("data/titanic3.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
stress <- read.table("data/stressEcho.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
```

---

## The R workspace I

As already mentioned now several times, everything is considered to be an
object in R. These objects are living in the so-called workspace. The
workspace in R is comparable with a desk. The content of this
workspace/desk can be shown with the command

```{r, comment=NA}
ls()
```

The `ls()` command shows all active R objects, unneeded objects can be
removed via `rm()` command. Assuming we have an object foo we can
remove it be typing
```{r eval=FALSE}
rm(foo)
```
and all objects of a workspace can removed by
```{r eval=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
```

---

## The R workspace II

One can store the entire workspace and restore it later on. For that are the
commands `save.image()` and the `load()`command available.
If one want to save a workspace the command is
```{r eval=FALSE}
save.image(file="myRsession.RData")
```

and one can load it via

```{r eval=FALSE}
load(file="myRsession.RData")
```

This is especially then usful when one works on different projects where the calculations
take a while and cannot be easily repeated.

---

## How to continue

* After importing the data to R, the first step is to check if the data was imported properly!

* It is a common source of error to import the data wrongly without noticing it in the first place!

* But how to check if the data was imported properly? For that some background of R's data types and data structures is needed.

* Each (data) object in a programming language is of a certain type and is handled different.

* R knows basically 5 different data types:

1. The empty set. Example: `NULL`. Name: NULL.
2. Logical values. Example: `TRUE`. Name: logical.
3. Real values. Example: `3.13` or `4`. Name: numeric.
4. Complex values. Example: `5.22+1i`. Name: complex.
5. Letters and strings. Example: `"Hei hei"`. Name: character.

---

## Standard data formats I

* In R everything is an object.

* Although R isn't a classical object orientated programming language, we use this term here.

* Values can be stored in variables.

* Variables can be of very different type and have very different properties, depending on the purpose for what we need them!

* Also functions return objects (also here are different types possible).

* __Question__: What for do I need these variables and how do I use them?!

---

## Standard data formats II

The standard data objects for numbers (numeric) and strings (character) are

1. `vector`
2. `matrix` or `data.frame`
3. `list`
4. `array`
5. `factor`
6. `(function)`

* Each data structure has it’s own properties and we are going through them soon.

* The main idea of a data structure is to store the previous result and make it later accessible!

---

## data structure: Vector

* The vector structure is similar to vectors known from mathematics.

* You can compare vectors with houses along a street.

* There is clearly defined how many houses there are (= length of the vector).

* Each house has it’s clear position that can be addressed.

* The only difference is, at each postion only one element is allowed and all elements have to be the same type. (This is then the difference to a real street, hopefully!)

---

## Data structure: Vector II

* A vector in R is a sequence of elements that have all the same mode. 

* The easiest way to create a vector is using the `c()` function. 

* The function is used as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
vectorname <- c(value1, value2, ...)
```

* A single number is also treated like a vector but can be easier assigned to an object:
```{r eval=FALSE}
vectorname <- value1
```

---

## Data structures: Vector III

* Let’s assign some values:
```{r}
 peter.height <- 190
 paul.height <- 188
 kati.height <- 179
```

* These are now special type of vectors, because they have just length 1! 

* Let’s combine now these special vectors:

```{r}
all.height <- c(peter.height, paul.height, kati.height)
heights <- c(190, 188, 179)
```

---

## Data structures: Vector IV

* Just by typing the name of an object (here the vector) into the console, R displays its content.

```{r comment=NA}
all.height
heights
```

---

## Data structure: Vector V

* As mentioned in the street example, each position in a vector can be
addressed:
```{r comment=NA}
 heights[1]
 all.height[3]
```

We can also see the length of a vector:

```{r comment=NA}
length(heights)
```

---

# Data structure: matrix I

* The matrix structure is also similar to matrices known from mathematics.

* You can compare them with a chessboard.

* There is clear defined how many fields there are (= 'product of the edges').

* Each cell has it’s clear position that can be addressed.

* The only difference is also here all elements have to be the same type and it can be rectangular, with arbitrary sizes.

---

## Data structure: matrix II

* Matrices are filled using vectors:

```{r comment=NA}
 myMatrix <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), ncol=3)
 myMatrix
 myMatrix2 <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
 myMatrix2

```

---

## Data structure: matrix III

* And also here, we can get the certain dimensions

```{r comment=NA}
 nrow(myMatrix)
 ncol(myMatrix)
 length(myMatrix)
```

---

## Data structure: matrix IV

* In order to access specific elements in a matrix, we have to give 2 positions, or the column/row number of interest

```{r comment=NA}
 myMatrix[1,3]
 myMatrix[2,]
 myMatrix[,1]
```

---

## Data structure: matrix V

We can also change certain entries in the matrix

```{r comment=NA}
 myMatrix[1,3] <- 100
 myMatrix
 myMatrix[1,] <- c(5,9,2)
 myMatrix
``` 

---

## Data structure: matrix VI

We can also change certain entries in the matrix

```{r comment=NA}
 myMatrix[,2] <- c(7,3)
 myMatrix
```

---

## Interruption

It is already time to review some things that happened here!

1. We saw that basically everything happened by using functions. The general syntax was:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Functionname(Argument)
```

2. We saw also that all functions return objects, e.g. the command to
get the number of rows of matrix `nrow()` gives a vector of length 1
with the result.

3. As a special command we had the `matrix()` command. Maybe you
have noticed that it took 2 arguments as input! These arguments
have been separated by comma and we will see this more frequent in
the future!

---

## Hands-On: Assigning values

1. Assign values 4, 6 and 12 to the object `test`
2. Change the second element of `test` then to 14
3. Create a matrix testMat that looks like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
testMat <- matrix(c(5,6,3,12), ncol=2)
```
```{r comment=NA}
testMat
```

4. Display the second column of the matrix testMat

---

## Hands-On: Solutions 1&2

1. Assign values 4, 6 and 12 to the object `test`

```{r comment=NA}
 test <- c(4,6,12)
 test
```

2. Change the second element of `test` then to 14

```{r comment=NA}
 test[2] <- 14
 test
```

---
## Hands-On: Solutions 3&4

3. Create a matrix testMat that looks like this:

```{r comment=NA}
 testMat <- matrix(c(5,3,6,12),ncol=2)
 testMat
```

4. Display the second column of the matrix testMat

```{r comment=NA}
 testMat[,2]
```

---
## Different data types in a vector
So far we introduced vectors and matrices but used numbers in it. Well,
what about text?! In categorical data text objects are commonly used,
different sequences might be non-numerical coded, gene names, etc.
Text (or better ’strings’) are identified with quotations:
```{r comment=NA}
 myString <- "Peter Pan"
 myString
```
 
But what happens now, when we combine strings and numbers?!
Remember, I said earlier, in matrices and vectors are only same object
types allowed.

```{r comment=NA}
myNewString <- c(myString,"Robin Hood",123)
myNewString
```

---

## Data structure: data.frame I

One data structure that overcomes the limitation that all elements have to
be of the same class is the data.frame:

```{r comment=NA}
 myDF <- data.frame(height = c(190, 187, 178),
                    name = c("Peter", "Paul", "Kati"))
 myDF
```

---
## Data structure: data.frame II

data.frame are practically vectors of same length that are organized in a matrix similar shape.

```{r comment=NA}
 myDF[,1]
 myDF[,2]
```

---

## Data structure: factor I

Here we saw already the next type of data structure / type: the factor
type. It is especially used for categorical data or status information like
male / female, placebo / drug. etc.
Possible values are called here levels. All levels from such a data
structure can then be shown via

```{r comment=NA}
 levels(myDF[,2])
```

One has to be very careful with factors, as they might behave not in such
a way as one would always assume! In the beginning it might be a good
advise to use factors only in those situation, where you really know what
you are doing. Later on we will see examples of situations, where the use
of factors might lead to undesired results. For now we don’t go into the
details.
But - how can we avoid that R uses factors here?!

---

## Data structure: factor II

By default R interprets strings as factors. This behaviour can be changed
using the additional option stringsAsFactors:

```{r comment=NA}
 myDF <- data.frame(height = c(190, 187, 178),
                   name = c("Peter", "Paul", "Kati"),
                   stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
 myDF
```

---

## Data structure: factor II

```{r comment=NA} 
 myDF[,1]
 myDF[,2]
```

---

## Our data example

* Lets come back to our data example.

* Earlier we imported the two datsets `titanic` and `stressEcho`.

* Back then we said we have to check, if they have been properly imported, we can do this now!

```{r, comment=NA}
 stress[1:6,1:12]
```

---

## Our data example
```{r, comment=NA}
 str(stress)
```

--- 
## Naming of element
* We just saw, list items can have names that can be accessed with the $ sign.

* Names were assigned in the definition of the list by using the `=` symbol.

* We did the same already earlier, when we had the data.frame. It works there the same way:

* Lets check the first 25 elements of the column named `bhr` in the data.frame `stress`:

```{r, comment=NA}
 stress$bhr[1:25]
```

---
## Getting the column names of a data.frame

* There are commands to set and get the column names of a matrix or data.frame.

* This is called `colnames()`:

```{r, comment=NA}
 colnames(stress)
```

---
## Summary break

* It is again time to review some things that happened here!

1. We saw that R might change the data type by itself!
2. These changes are not visible on the first view.
3. We don’t have to panic! The previously introduced concepts will soon be intuitively to use.

* What can we do already?!
1. We can write values into variables (using <-).
2. We can access values from variables (using [,]).
3. We know that there are different data types (numerical and strings).
4. We can give names to columns and list items.

---
## Hands-On: Titanic data

1. Check if you imported the dataset `titanic` properly
2. Print the column with the names of the passengers

---
## Hints: Titanic data

1. Use `str()` and the square brackets `[]`
2. Use the `$` sign, once you know how the column is called.

---
## Solutions: Titanic data

1. Check if you imported the dataset `titanic` properly

```{r comment=NA}
str(titanic) 
```

---

## Solutions: Titanic data II

2. Check if you imported the dataset `titanic` properly

```{r comment=NA}
titanic$name
```

---

## data structure: list I

* So far we had all kind of data structures that are more or less known from mathematics.

* But what if we want to combine elements that do not have same dimensions?

* A list fulfills such a purpose, and it ’sits on top’ of the previous introduced structures.

* Think of a list as a necklace: pearls are sequentially, but can be completely different. Some necklaces have even big constructions
  hanging in between. All this is also possible by using lists.

* In order to read/write into a list, we need double square brackets `[[ ]]`

---

## Data structure: list II

An example of an list:

```{r comment=NA}
 rooms <- c("F001","F002","F003")
 building <- c("Datum","Alimentum")
 someData <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4),ncol=2)
 myList <- list(rooms, building, someData)
```

---

## Data structure : list III

```{r, comment=NA}
 myList
```

---

## Data structure : list IV
Accessing the second element of the list `myList`:
```{r, comment=NA}
 myList[[2]]
```

Printing the vector `building`:
```{r, comment=NA}
 building
```

---

## Named elements in the list

* Now we combine the elements not only by putting them into a `list()` command.

* At the same time we will give them names:

```{r comment=NA}
 rooms <- c("F001","F002","F003")
 building <- c("Datum","Alimentum")
 someData <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4),ncol=2)
 myList2 <- list(TheRooms=rooms, build=building, data=someData)
```

---

## Data structure : list III

```{r, comment=NA}
 myList2
```

---

## Data structure : list IV
Accessing the second element of the list `myList`:
```{r, comment=NA}
 myList2[[2]]
```

Printing the column called `build`:
```{r, comment=NA}
myList2$build
```

---

## Data structure: list V

* It is very important to understand the concept of a list in R, as it is a commonly used structure.

* Many functions report back the results in form of lists.

* A typical example is a statistical test that reports then e.g. back:

  1. Value of the test statistic ($statistic)
  2. P-value ($p.value)
  3. Confidence intervall ($conf.int)
  4.  . . . .

## R as pocket calculator

It is easy to use R as a basic pocket calculator
```{r comment=NA}
1+2*3
2*5^2 - 11
sqrt(9)
cos(2*pi)
```

---

## R as pocket calculator II

---

## Perform basic calculations

* Now after we know what basic data types and structures are available, what can we do with them!?

* We saw already that R can be used as simple pocket calculator, so what happens when you do the same with the other data structures?
 (Remember, a single value is considered to be a vector of length 1!)

```{r comment=NA}
 x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
 x*2
```

* R works vector-based. This means, the 2 is internally repeated so many times, that the length of the vectors match, like this:
```{r comment=NA}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
x*c(2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2)
```

## Perform basic calculations II

Table 3: Basic functions in R

Command            |  Explanation
-------------------|---------------------------
`mean()`, `median()` |  Mean, median
`sd()`, `var()`    |  Standard deviation, variance
`min()`, `max()`   |  Extreme values
`range()`          |  Both extreme values
`sort()`           |  Sort a vector

---

## Handling missing data

* R denotes missing data usually with `NA`.

* Missing data is a pain for most calculations, as it is not clear how to handle it!

* Most function provide options to define how to handle missing data:

```{r comment=NA}
x <- c(4,3,2,NA,78)
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## Hands-On: Example data

1. Calculate the mean age of the Titanic passengers
2. How many passengers survived the Titanic tragedy?
3. What is the smallest/largest basic heart rate in the stress data?
4. What is the Standard deviation of the Age in the stress data?

---

## Hints: Example data

1. Use the `mean()` function. Columns you can access with `$` or with `[]`.
2. People how survived are encoded as 1. A sum over the corresponding column gives the total amount.
3. You could use either `min()`/`max()` or `range()` on the column `bhr`.
4. The required function is called `sd()`.

---

## Solutions: Example data I

1. Calculate the mean age of the Titanic passengers
```{r comment=NA}
mean(titanic$age, na.rm=TRUE)
```

2. How many passengers survived the Titanic tragedy?
```{r comment=NA}
sum(titanic$survived)
```

---

## Solutions: Example data II

3. What is the smallest/largest basic heart rate in the stress data?
```{r comment=NA}
range(stress$bhr)
```

4. What is the Standard deviation of the Age in the stress data?
```{r comment=NA}
sd(stress$age)
```

---

## Sequences and repetitions I

* Often we are interested in sequences and repeated values - and writting them by hand is laborious.

* The commands `rep()`, `seq()` and `:` make the life easier:

```{r comment=NA}
x <- seq(from=1, to=10, by=1)
x
1:10
```

---

## Sequences and repetitions II

Especially the rep command is very powerful:

To simply repeat a single value, the `times` argument can be used

```{r comment=NA}
rep(2, times=10)
```

The same option can also repeat whole vectors

```{r comment=NA}
rep(c(1,2), times=3)
```

---

## Sequences and repetitions III
Further, single elements of a vector can be repeated with the `each` option
```{r comment=NA}
rep(c(1,2), each=3)
```

And finally, elements of a vector can be repeated individually

``` {r comment=NA}
rep(c(1,2), times=c(3,4))
```

---

## Recycling of vectors

The internal repetition to make vectors fit for arithmetic operations is called in R ’recycling’.

```{r comment=NA}
x <- 1:10
x*c(1,2)
x*c(1,2,3)
```

---

## Logical operators in I 

Table 5: Logical Operators in R

Command       |  Explanation
--------------|---------------------------
`==`          |  equals
`!=`          |  unequal
`<`           |  smaller
`<=`          |  smaller or equal
`>`           |  larger
`>=`          |  larger or equal
`!`           |  NOT
`&`           |  AND
\|            |  OR
`TRUE`        |  true 
`FALSE`       |  false

---

## Logical operators in R - example

Print the first 20 elements of the `basebp` column:

```{r comment=NA}
stress$basebp[1:20]
```
Now check, which of those is larger than 150:
```{r comment=NA}
stress$basebp[1:20]>150
```

---

## Combine logic operators

One can combine logical operations, e.g. basebp larger than 150 and male:
```{r comment=NA}
(stress$basebp[1:40]>150) & (stress$gender[1:40]=="male") 
```

One can even use the logical output to access rows/columns of a data.frame:
```{r comment=NA}
stress[(stress$basebp>190) & (stress$gender=="male"), c(1:7,15,16)]
```

---

## Hands on: Sequences, Recycling and Logic

1. Create a vector with elements `2,4,6,8,...,100` and calculate the mean of it.
2. Get from that vector all elements that are larger than 80.
3. Extract every 10th row from the `titanic` data set
4. How many individuals in the `stress` data are older than 70?
5. Count the female / male survivors on Titanic

---

## Hints: Sequences, Recycling and Logic

1. Use the `seq()`command with `from`, `to` and `by` options
2. Use the logic operator with the square brackets `[]` to access the right elements.
3. Create first the required sequence with `seq()` and then plug it into the square brackets `[]`
4. Use the logic operator on the `age` column and then make use of thefact that `TRUE`counts as 1 and `FALSE`counts as 0.
5. Use the logic operator on the `sex` column and plug this into the `survivor` column - then proceed as in the earlier Hands on exercise

---

## Solutions: Sequences, Recycling and Logic I

1. Create a vector with elements `2,4,6,8,...,100` and calculate the mean of it.
```{r comment=NA}
 x <- seq(from=2, to=100, by=2)
 x
```

2. Get from that vector all elements that are larger than 80.
```{r comment=NA}
x[x>80]
```

---

## Solutions: Sequences, Recycling and Logic II

3. Extract every 10th row from the `titanic` data set (output truncated)
```{r comment=NA, eval=FALSE}
titanic[seq(10,1300,10),]
```
```{r comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
titanic[seq(10,110,10),c(1,2,4:10)]
```

---

## Solutions: Sequences, Recycling and Logic III

4. How many individuals in the `stress` data are older than 70?
```{r comment=NA}
sum(stress$age>70)
```

5. Count the female / male survivors on Titanic
```{r comment=NA}
sum(titanic$survived[titanic$sex=="female"])
sum(titanic$survived[titanic$sex=="male"])
```

## Packages on Cran I

* R comes with a lot of basic functionality, but there are plenty of applications that cannot be covered from the core system.
* In order to extend the functionality of R there is a package system where user can provide their own functions for other users.
* The quality differs a lot between different packages, there are very rudimental packages and very sophisticated available.
* Currently there are about 5000 packages available and there is an overview here:

[Available packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)

---

## Packages on Cran II

* In order to use packages they first have to be installed. 
* In most R editors there is a graphical menu to do that, otherwise there is a command `install.library()` available.
* Once a package is installed the functionality can be loaded with the `library` command.
* Many packages contain besides functions also dataset that can be used to test the functions of it.

* To install and load a package (e.g. `MASS`) one can type

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("MASS")
library("MASS")
```

## Explorative data analysis

After importing a dataset and verifying that everything went fine with the import, one usually starts
to explore the dataset in order to get 'a feeling' for it.

This usually involves to calculate some key location statistics (mean, median, quantiles) as well as first, basic visualizations.

Common visualizations are 'Scatterplots' and 'Boxplots'

The commands we will use for the first EDA steps are `summary()`, `boxplot()`, and `plot()`

---

## `summary()` command

The easiest way to get a first impression of the data is to use the `summary()`command. 

It gives us the 5 point (plus mean) summary of a vector. 

We apply the function onto the `stress$bhr` data:

```{r comment=NA}
summary(stress$bhr)
```
